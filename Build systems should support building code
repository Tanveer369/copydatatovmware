write steps in detail
Sure, here are the detailed steps for automating the building of code for the Teancenter Active Workspace project using Jenkins and other automation tools:

Setting up Jenkins:
a. Download and install Jenkins on the server where the build process will run.
b. Open Jenkins in a web browser and navigate to the "Manage Jenkins" page.
c. Install the Git plugin from the "Manage Plugins" section if it is not already installed.
d. Go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Global Tool Configuration" and configure the Git plugin by specifying the path to the Git executable on the server.

Create a Jenkins job:
a. Click on "New Item" from the Jenkins dashboard to create a new Jenkins job.
b. Enter a name for the job and select "Freestyle project" as the type.
c. In the "Source Code Management" section, select "Git" as the option and enter the URL of the Git repository where the Teancenter Active Workspace project is hosted.
d. In the "Build" section, select "Invoke top-level Maven targets" as the option.
e. Specify the project-specific settings such as the Maven goals, options, and profiles.
f. Click "Save" to create the Jenkins job.

Configure Maven:
a. Download and install Apache Maven on the server where the build process will run.
b. Configure Maven to use the Nexus Repository Manager for dependency management by specifying the appropriate repository URL and credentials in the Maven settings.xml file.

Configure Nexus:
a. Download and install the Nexus Repository Manager on the server where the build process will run.
b. Configure Nexus to store the project artifacts and dependencies by creating a new Maven repository in Nexus.
c. Create a new user in Nexus and give it the necessary privileges to deploy artifacts and manage the repository.

Configure Git:
a. Open the Git repository where the Teancenter Active Workspace project is hosted.
b. Go to the "Settings" page and select "Webhooks".
c. Add a new webhook and specify the URL of the Jenkins job that was created in step 2 as the endpoint.
d. Select the events that should trigger the webhook, such as "Push" or "Merge Request".

Build the project:
a. Commit and push changes to the Git repository to trigger the Jenkins job.
b. Jenkins will automatically download the latest code from the Git repository, build the project using Maven, and deploy the artifacts to the Nexus repository.

Deploy the project:
a. Configure Jenkins to deploy the built artifacts to the appropriate environment, such as a test or production environment.
b. Use a plugin such as the "Deploy to container Plugin" to deploy the artifacts to a container such as Tomcat.

Automation:

To automate the entire process, schedule the Jenkins job to run at regular intervals using the Jenkins scheduler. The Git plugin can be configured to trigger the job whenever there is a new commit to the repository. Maven can be configured to automatically download the latest dependencies from the Nexus repository. All of these tasks can be automated and scheduled to run at regular intervals using Jenkins.

write a jenkins CICD usecase with using automation tools to Build systems should support building code - Active Workspace Project-specific All Active workspace code Build itself is a part of a bigger/parent pipeline write usecase, technical component, steps, technical specification
Use Case
Active Workspace is a project that involves several developers working on a web application. The project code is stored in a Git repository, and the team uses Jenkins to automate the build process and ensure that code changes are quickly and safely deployed to production.
The Jenkins pipeline is a part of a bigger/parent pipeline that includes other stages, such as testing, packaging, and deploying the application to Kubernetes. The build system should support building code for all Active Workspace project-specific modules, including dependencies.

Technical Components
The technical components required to implement the CICD pipeline for Active Workspace include:
Git for source code management
Jenkins for pipeline automation
Maven or Gradle for building the code
Ansible or Chef for configuration management
Kubernetes for container orchestration
Steps
The following steps describe the process of implementing the CICD pipeline for Active Workspace:
Step 1: Set up the Git repository

Create a new Git repository to store the Active Workspace project code.
Configure access control to allow collaboration between developers.
Step 2: Configure the build system

Install Maven or Gradle to compile, test, and package the code.
Configure the build system to support building code for all Active Workspace project-specific modules.
Step 3: Install and configure Jenkins

Install Jenkins on a server.
Configure Jenkins to integrate with Git and the build system.
Create a new pipeline job and link it to the Git repository.
Step 4: Define the pipeline script

Define the stages of the pipeline script, including compiling the code, running tests, and packaging the application.
Define the pipeline triggers, such as polling the VCS for changes or triggering the pipeline manually.
Step 5: Integrate with the build system

Use Jenkins plugins or shell commands to execute build commands and generate build reports.
Configure the pipeline script to retrieve the build output.
Step 6: Configure the configuration management tool

Install Ansible or Chef to manage the infrastructure required for the application to run.
Configure the tool to create and manage the infrastructure.
Step 7: Configure the deployment tool

Install Kubernetes to deploy the application to the infrastructure.
Configure the tool to deploy the application.
Step 8: Configure the Jenkins deployment configuration

Use the Jenkins pipeline script to deploy changes to production automatically when tests pass and a new version of the application is built successfully.
Technical Specification
The technical specification for the Active Workspace CICD pipeline includes the following:
The Git repository should be configured with access control to allow collaboration between developers.
The build system should be configured with Maven or Gradle to support building code for all Active Workspace project-specific modules, including dependencies.
Jenkins should be installed on a server and configured to integrate with Git and the build system. A new pipeline job should be created and linked to the Git repository.
The pipeline script should define the stages of the pipeline, including compiling the code, running tests, and packaging the application. The pipeline triggers should be defined, such as polling the VCS for changes or triggering the pipeline manually.
Jenkins plugins or shell commands should be used to execute build commands and generate build reports. The pipeline script should retrieve the build output.
Ansible or Chef should be installed and configured to manage the infrastructure required for the application to run.
Kubernetes should be installed and configured to deploy the application to the infrastructure.
The Jenkins pipeline script should be configured to deploy changes to production automatically when tests pass and a new version of the application is built successfully.
