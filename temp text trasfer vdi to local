Initial Setup on AWS Cloud Systems

Adapt the system settings for a new system created from existing system image, or Teamcenter specific configuration adaptation
Proxy Settings, No Proxy hosts bashrc pass system aliases hostfile configuration Certificates

Additionally, store the system configuration in GIT/DB/??


Sure, here are the steps to automate the use case using Jenkins and Ansible:

1. Provision an AWS EC2 Instance: Use an AWS CloudFormation template to provision a new EC2 instance on 
AWS Cloud Systems with an existing system image or Teamcenter specific configuration. 
Ensure that the instance is properly configured with an appropriate operating system, system resources, and security settings.

2. Install and Configure Jenkins: Install Jenkins on the EC2 instance and configure it to manage the CI/CD pipeline. 
Configure Jenkins to use the Git repository for source code management.

3. Set up a Jenkins Job: Create a new Jenkins job to build and deploy the application to the AWS EC2 instance. 
The job should include the following steps:
     Checkout code from the Git repository.
     Build the application code using a build tool, such as Maven or Gradle.
     Test the application using automated tests, such as JUnit or Selenium.
     Use Ansible to adapt the system settings on the AWS EC2 instance. Ansible can be used to update the bashrc file, 
     configure system aliases, update the hostfile configuration, and install SSL certificates.
     Deploy the application to the AWS EC2 instance using Ansible.
     
4. Install and Configure Ansible: Install Ansible on the EC2 instance and configure it to manage the system settings. 
Configure Ansible to use the Git repository for configuration management.

5. Create an Ansible Playbook: Create an Ansible playbook to configure the system settings on the AWS EC2 instance. 
The playbook should include tasks to:
     Update Proxy Settings: If your network uses a proxy server to access the internet, update the proxy settings in the new system.
Configure No Proxy Hosts: Configure the no-proxy hosts to access resources on your local network that should not be accessed through the proxy server.
     Update Bashrc: Update the bashrc file with any customizations to the shell environment, such as aliases or environment variables.
     Configure System Aliases: Configure any custom system aliases that are frequently used.
Update Hostfile Configuration: Update the hostfile configuration to access resources on your local network using hostnames rather than IP addresses.
     Install SSL Certificates: Install SSL certificates to enable secure communication on your network.

6. Store System Configuration: Use a Git repository to store configuration files for the application and system settings. 
Use Ansible to manage the system configuration.

By automating these steps using Jenkins and Ansible, you can ensure that your system is properly configured and that 
changes are integrated and tested before deployment. This approach also allows you to easily replicate your 
configuration across multiple instances or environments.

c. Update Bashrc: Update the bashrc file with any customizations to the shell environment, such as aliases or environment variables.
d. Configure System Aliases: Configure any custom system aliases that are frequently used.
e. Update Hostfile Configuration: Update the hostfile configuration to access resources on the local network using hostnames rather than IP addresses.
f. Install SSL Certificates: Install SSL certificates to enable secure communication on the network.

4. Store the Ansible playbook and system configuration files in Git. Use Git to manage and version control the system configuration files.

5. Install and configure Jenkins on the AWS EC2 instance.

6. Create a Jenkins job to automate the CICD process. The job should include the following steps:

a. Checkout code from the Git repository.
b. Build the application code using a build tool, such as Maven or Gradle.
c. Test the application using automated tests, such as JUnit or Selenium.
d. Use Ansible to adapt the system settings on the AWS EC2 instance. Use Vault to securely manage any secrets required by 
e. the playbook, such as SSL certificates.
f. Deploy the application to the AWS EC2 instance using Ansible.

7. Store the Jenkins job and pipeline configuration in Git. Use Git to manage and version control the CI/CD pipeline 
configuration.

8. Configure Jenkins to trigger the CI/CD pipeline automatically when changes are made to the Git repository.

9. Test the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that the application is built, tested, and deployed to the AWS EC2 instance 
with the required system settings.

By automating these steps, you can ensure that your system is properly configured and that changes are 
integrated and tested before deployment. This approach also allows you to easily replicate your configuration 
across multiple instances or environments.
