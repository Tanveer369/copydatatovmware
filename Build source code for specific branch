Build source code on ad-hoc basis

write CICD usecase with steps, technical modules and technical specification for Build source code for specific branch - Build source code on ad-hoc basis using jenkins and automation tools

Sure, here's an example of a more detailed CI/CD use case for building source code for a specific branch on an ad-hoc basis using Jenkins and automation tools.

Use case: Build source code for specific branch on ad-hoc basis

Steps:

Developer creates a new branch for a feature or bug fix and pushes the code changes to the version control system.
Jenkins detects the changes and triggers a build job for the specific branch using a webhook or polling mechanism.
The build job checks out the source code from the version control system and compiles the code.
Automated tests are run against the compiled code to verify its correctness and detect any issues.
If the tests pass, the build artifacts are archived and stored for future use.
The build job sends a notification to the development team about the build status, including any issues or failures encountered.
If the build fails, the development team is notified and can investigate and resolve the issue before merging the code changes back into the main branch.
Once the build is successful, the development team can merge the code changes back into the main branch and trigger another build job to ensure that the changes are integrated properly.
The build artifacts can be deployed to a testing environment for further verification or released to production if the testing is successful.
Technical modules:

Version control system (e.g., Git, SVN) - Used for storing and managing the source code.
Jenkins - Used for automating the build and testing process.
Build tools (e.g., Maven, Gradle) - Used for compiling the source code and building the artifacts.
Automated testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit, Selenium) - Used for running automated tests against the build artifacts.
Notification tools (e.g., Slack, email) - Used for notifying the development team about the build status.
Technical specifications:

Jenkins server - Installed on a dedicated machine or container with the necessary resources (e.g., CPU, RAM, storage) to handle the build and testing workload.
Build tools and automated testing frameworks - Installed as plugins or dependencies within Jenkins to simplify the build process.
Jenkins job - Configured to pull the source code from the version control system, compile the code, run automated tests, and archive the build artifacts.
Notification tools - Configured to send notifications to the development team about the build status, including any issues or failures encountered.
By using Jenkins and automation tools, this CI/CD use case ensures that code changes are properly validated and integrated into the main branch before being released to production, reducing the risk of introducing bugs or errors into the software.
