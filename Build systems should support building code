Use Case
Active Workspace is a project that involves several developers working on a web application. The project code is stored in a Git repository, and the team uses Jenkins to automate the build process and ensure that code changes are quickly and safely deployed to production.
The Jenkins pipeline is a part of a bigger/parent pipeline that includes other stages, such as testing, packaging, and deploying the application to Kubernetes. The build system should support building code for all Active Workspace project-specific modules, including dependencies.

Technical Components
The technical components required to implement the CICD pipeline for Active Workspace include:
Git for source code management
Jenkins for pipeline automation
Maven or Gradle for building the code
Ansible or Chef for configuration management
Kubernetes for container orchestration
Steps
The following steps describe the process of implementing the CICD pipeline for Active Workspace:
Step 1: Set up the Git repository

Create a new Git repository to store the Active Workspace project code.
Configure access control to allow collaboration between developers.
Step 2: Configure the build system

Install Maven or Gradle to compile, test, and package the code.
Configure the build system to support building code for all Active Workspace project-specific modules.
Step 3: Install and configure Jenkins

Install Jenkins on a server.
Configure Jenkins to integrate with Git and the build system.
Create a new pipeline job and link it to the Git repository.
Step 4: Define the pipeline script

Define the stages of the pipeline script, including compiling the code, running tests, and packaging the application.
Define the pipeline triggers, such as polling the VCS for changes or triggering the pipeline manually.
Step 5: Integrate with the build system

Use Jenkins plugins or shell commands to execute build commands and generate build reports.
Configure the pipeline script to retrieve the build output.
Step 6: Configure the configuration management tool

Install Ansible or Chef to manage the infrastructure required for the application to run.
Configure the tool to create and manage the infrastructure.
Step 7: Configure the deployment tool

Install Kubernetes to deploy the application to the infrastructure.
Configure the tool to deploy the application.
Step 8: Configure the Jenkins deployment configuration

Use the Jenkins pipeline script to deploy changes to production automatically when tests pass and a new version of the application is built successfully.
Technical Specification
The technical specification for the Active Workspace CICD pipeline includes the following:
The Git repository should be configured with access control to allow collaboration between developers.
The build system should be configured with Maven or Gradle to support building code for all Active Workspace project-specific modules, including dependencies.
Jenkins should be installed on a server and configured to integrate with Git and the build system. A new pipeline job should be created and linked to the Git repository.
The pipeline script should define the stages of the pipeline, including compiling the code, running tests, and packaging the application. The pipeline triggers should be defined, such as polling the VCS for changes or triggering the pipeline manually.
Jenkins plugins or shell commands should be used to execute build commands and generate build reports. The pipeline script should retrieve the build output.
Ansible or Chef should be installed and configured to manage the infrastructure required for the application to run.
Kubernetes should be installed and configured to deploy the application to the infrastructure.
The Jenkins pipeline script should be configured to deploy changes to production automatically when tests pass and a new version of the application is built successfully.

Git: Create a new Git repository and configure access control.
Build system: Install Maven or Gradle and configure it to support building code for all Active Workspace project-specific modules.
Jenkins: Install Jenkins on a server and configure it to integrate with Git and the build system. Install necessary plugins and create a new pipeline job linked to the Git repository.
Pipeline script: Define the stages of the pipeline script, including compiling the code, running tests, and packaging the application. Define the pipeline triggers and configure the script to retrieve the build output.
Configuration management tool: Install and configure Ansible or Chef to manage the infrastructure required for the application to run.
Deployment tool: Install and configure Kubernetes to deploy the application to the infrastructure.
Deployment configuration: Configure the Jenkins pipeline script to deploy changes to production automatically when tests pass and a new version of the application is built successfully.
Conclusion
The Active Workspace CICD pipeline is an essential part of the development process for this web application project. With Git for source code management, Jenkins for automation, Maven or Gradle for building, Ansible or Chef for configuration management, and Kubernetes for container orchestration, the team can ensure that code changes are quickly and safely deployed to production. By following the technical specification and configuration outlined in this use case, the team can effectively implement and manage the CICD pipeline for Active Workspace.
