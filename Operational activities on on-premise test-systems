Use Case:
A software development team has a suite of applications running on multiple on-premise test-systems. These applications are developed and tested on a daily basis, and often require debugging for troubleshooting purposes. The team wants to automate the process of enabling debugging on these test-systems using Jenkins, Ansible, and Python to save time and ensure consistency across all test-systems.

Technical module with tool names:

Jenkins - a popular continuous integration and delivery tool.
Ansible - an open-source automation tool used for configuration management and application deployment.
Python - a general-purpose programming language used for automation and scripting.
Steps:

Write an Ansible playbook to enable debugging on the test-systems.
Create a Python script to trigger the Ansible playbook using the Ansible API.
Write a Jenkinsfile to automate the process of triggering the Python script.
Set up a Jenkins job to trigger the Jenkinsfile.
Monitor the debugging process and receive notifications upon completion.
Technical specifications:

Ansible playbook - The Ansible playbook should be written in YAML and include the necessary tasks to enable debugging on the test-systems. The playbook should be able to handle any errors that occur during the debugging process. The playbook should also include a variable file with the required configuration details for the test-systems, such as the IP address, port number, and debug flags.
Python script - The Python script should be written in Python and use the Ansible API to trigger the Ansible playbook. The script should handle any errors that occur during the process of triggering the playbook. The script should also be able to read the variable file created in the Ansible playbook and pass the required configuration details to the Ansible playbook.
Jenkinsfile - The Jenkinsfile should be written in Groovy and include the necessary commands to trigger the Python script. The Jenkinsfile should be able to handle any errors that occur during the process of triggering the Python script. The Jenkinsfile should also send email notifications upon completion of the debugging process. The Jenkinsfile should also include a pipeline step to download the latest version of the Ansible playbook from the Git repository before executing it.
Jenkins job - The Jenkins job should be set up to trigger the Jenkinsfile. The job can be configured using the Jenkins pipeline syntax. The job should also be set up to execute on a schedule, such as once per day, to ensure that the test-systems are always running the latest version of the applications with debugging enabled.
Monitoring - Jenkins should be configured to send email notifications upon completion of the debugging process. Alternatively, a monitoring tool such as Nagios or Zabbix can be used to monitor the test-systems and send notifications upon completion.
Technical Steps:

Write an Ansible playbook:
The first step is to write an Ansible playbook using the YAML syntax to enable debugging on the test-systems. The playbook should include the necessary tasks to enable debugging on the test-systems, such as installing and configuring the debugging tools, setting the required flags, and starting the debugging process. The playbook should also include a variable file with the required configuration details for the test-systems, such as the IP address, port number, and debug flags.

Create a Python script:
The next step is to create a Python script that uses the Ansible API to trigger the Ansible playbook. The script should handle any errors that occur during the process of triggering the playbook. The script should also be able to read the variable file created in the Ansible playbook and pass the required configuration details to the Ansible playbook. This can be achieved by importing the necessary Ansible modules and using the Ansible Python API to execute the playbook. The script can also be configured to print the output to the console or log it to a file for debugging purposes.

Write a Jenkinsfile:
The third step is to write a Jenkinsfile that automates the process of triggering the Python script. The Jenkinsfile should include the necessary commands to download the latest version of the Ansible playbook from the Git repository and execute the Python script. The Jenkinsfile should also be able to handle any errors that occur during the process of triggering the Python script. The Jenkinsfile can be configured to send email notifications upon completion of the debugging process using the Jenkins email-ext plugin.

Set up a Jenkins job:
The fourth step is to set up a Jenkins job to trigger the Jenkinsfile. This can be achieved by creating a new Jenkins job and selecting the "Pipeline" option. The job can be configured to execute on a schedule, such as once per day, to ensure that the test-systems are always running the latest version of the applications with debugging enabled. The job can also be configured to trigger on-demand using the Jenkins build button.

Monitoring:
The fifth step is to monitor the debugging process and receive notifications upon completion. This can be achieved by configuring Jenkins to send email notifications upon completion of the debugging process. Alternatively, a monitoring tool such as Nagios or Zabbix can be used to monitor the test-systems and send notifications upon completion.

In summary, enabling debugging on on-premise test-systems can be automated using a combination of Jenkins, Ansible, and Python. The Ansible playbook should be written in YAML and include the necessary tasks to enable debugging on the test-systems. The Python script should be written in Python and use the Ansible API to trigger the Ansible playbook. The Jenkinsfile should be written in Groovy and include the necessary commands to trigger the Python script. The Jenkins job should be set up to trigger the Jenkinsfile and execute on a schedule. Finally, monitoring can be achieved using Jenkins email notifications or a monitoring tool such as Nagios or Zabbix.
