Sure, here's an example of how to automate the process of incremental updates and system maintenance for on-premise test systems by preparing and updating certificates using Jenkins and different automation tools:

Technical Components:

Jenkins: An open-source automation server that can be used to automate various tasks, including building, testing, and deploying software.

Ansible: An open-source automation tool that allows us to configure and manage systems in a declarative manner.

HashiCorp Vault: An open-source tool for securely storing and accessing sensitive data, such as credentials and certificates.

OpenSSL: An open-source toolkit that can be used to generate and manage SSL/TLS certificates and keys.

Git: A version control system that allows us to track changes to files and collaborate with other developers.

Steps:

Set up the Jenkins job to trigger the Ansible playbook.

Define the Jenkins job parameters, such as the target systems to update, the path to the SSL/TLS certificate and key files, and the desired update interval.
Set up the Jenkins job to retrieve the required credentials from HashiCorp Vault securely.
Configure the Ansible playbook to generate and update the SSL/TLS certificates and keys.

Define the Ansible playbook tasks to generate new SSL/TLS certificates and keys using OpenSSL.
Define the Ansible playbook tasks to update the SSL/TLS certificates and keys on the target systems.
Define the Ansible playbook tasks to restart any relevant services to ensure they are using the new certificates.
Configure the Ansible playbook to run tests to validate that the new certificates are working as expected.

Define the Ansible playbook tasks to run tests on the target systems to ensure the new certificates are working as expected.
Define the Ansible playbook tasks to capture the test results and report any issues or failures.
If successful, configure the Git command to commit and push the updated configurations and scripts back to the Git repository.

Define the Git command to add the updated SSL/TLS certificate and key files to the repository.
Define the Git command to commit the changes with a descriptive message.
Define the Git command to push the changes to the remote Git repository.
Technical Specifications:

Jenkins version: 2.289.1 or higher.
Ansible version: 2.11 or higher.
HashiCorp Vault version: 1.7.2 or higher.
OpenSSL version: 1.1.1 or higher.
Git version: 2.30.2 or higher.
Operating system: Linux (e.g., CentOS, Ubuntu) or macOS.
Scripting language: Bash or Python.
SSL/TLS certificates and keys format: PEM or PKCS#12.

Automating Incremental Updates, System Maintenance, and Housekeeping Activities using Jenkins, Ansible, and Other Automation Tools:

Use Case:
In this scenario, we want to automate the process of Incremental Updates, System Maintenance, and Housekeeping Activities for On-Premise Test Systems. We will be using Jenkins as an automation server, Ansible for Incremental Updates and System Maintenance, and a Python script for Housekeeping Activities.

Technical Components:

Jenkins: An open-source automation server that can be used to schedule and execute jobs.
Ansible: An open-source automation tool that uses YAML-based configuration files to define tasks and playbooks.
Python: A general-purpose programming language that is easy to learn and widely used for automation.
Steps:

Install Jenkins, Ansible, and Python on the server that will be used for automation.
Create a Jenkins job that will execute the automation process. This job will have two build steps:
a. Ansible Build Step: This step will execute the Ansible playbook for Incremental Updates and System Maintenance. The playbook will contain the required tasks such as stopping the application, copying new files, and starting the application. The playbook will be executed on the remote servers using SSH. The inventory file will contain the list of remote servers that need to be updated.
b. Python Build Step: This step will execute a Python script for Housekeeping Activities. The Python script will perform tasks such as deleting old log files, cleaning up temporary files, and checking disk space usage. The Python script will be stored in a specified location on the server.
Schedule the Jenkins job to run at a specified time using the Jenkins scheduler.
Technical Specifications:

Jenkins: Jenkins provides a web-based interface to create and manage jobs. It also provides a build environment to execute build steps.
Ansible: Ansible uses SSH to connect and execute tasks on remote servers. It supports parallel execution of tasks and has a built-in mechanism to handle errors and retries. Ansible also provides a reporting mechanism to generate reports on the status of the automation process.
Python: Python is an easy-to-learn programming language that is widely used for automation. It provides a rich set of libraries for tasks such as file manipulation, text processing, and system administration.
Overall, this automated process will help save time and reduce errors in performing Incremental Updates, System Maintenance, and Housekeeping Activities for On-Premise Test Systems. By using Jenkins and Ansible, we can automate the update process and ensure that the updates are applied consistently across all servers. By using a Python script, we can perform housekeeping tasks efficiently and ensure that the server is running optimally.
